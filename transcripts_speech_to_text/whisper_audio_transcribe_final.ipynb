An itchy, flaky scalp could be dandruff, psoriasis or even dermatitis. Serious conditions that require serious treatment. Neutrogena T-gel is the only medicated shampoo containing Nutar, which is clinically proven to treat all three conditions. T-gel works immediately to reduce flakes, leaving hair soft and manageable. Don't put up with it. Treat it with Neutrogena T-gel at supermarkets and pharmacies. We're talking back and shoulder pain. Now Mark, most people just put up with it rather than treat it. Why is that? Well, it is easy to wait for pain to go away by itself. Not ideal, because to get moving again sooner, you need to treat pain early. You're best to have a chat with your pharmacist, who can give you a specialised treatment like Voltaren Rapid 25. It's proven to relieve strong pain and inflammation for up to eight hours. So treat back and shoulder pain early. Ask your pharmacist for Voltaren Rapid 25. A plane load. It's gonna be a lot of pain. It's gonna be an all-star flight. Of mean-ass actors. Love your work.

It's like a monster truck you can pour into your face. It's got electrolytes. What are electrolytes? I don't know but they're extremely awesome and Brondo is full of them. And they help plants grow. Which is why you should drink Brondo and not water because water is from the toilet and I've never seen plants grow out of a toilet. It's got caffeine. Super extra caffeine. And five kinds of sugar. Which makes it delicious and much better than other energy drinks that are not delicious. Drinking it will make you wonder why you haven't ever crushed a human skull with your bare hands. But you won't have to because you'll already know that Brondo tastes how that would feel. Which is like having sex with a tractor trailer in a parking lot. I just split my pants like the Incredible Hulk. See that? Brondo will make you need new pants. And while you're out buying new pants you should buy some new shoes because you're gonna wear out your shoes from kicking everyone's ass all the time. Brondo will make you want to kick everyone's ass all the time. Which might be good or bad but either way you're gonna win because Brondo will make you win at things you're not even supposed to win at. Like yelling. Brondo will make you win at yelling. Or maybe instead of yelling something else like jumping or waving. Because you'll be able to wave your hands really fast. And you'll probably become invisible. Which doesn't even make any sense. But if that doesn't happen then you'll probably just end up running somewhere. Which is good if you like running. But even if you don't Brondo will make you win at exercise.\", 'segments': [{'id': 0, 'seek': 0, 'start': 0.4, 'end': 1.8800000000000001, 'text': ' Brondo the Thirst Mutilator.', 'tokens': [50385,

With the Dessert Bullet, there's no delicious, nutritious dessert you can't make. Look at this decadent chocolate caramel parfait. Made from scratch, it's dairy-free, gluten-free, and is only 195 calories. Or what about this... Refreshing frozen lemonade.

And the next time the kids ask for ice cream, not only can you make it in seconds, but this old-fashioned chocolate dessert, like dozens of other kid favorites made with the Dessert Bullet, has no processed sugar, no food dyes, no dairy fats, and no nasty corn syrup. Plus, they're even loaded with ingredients... that are great for their digestive system, as well as strengthening their bones and teeth, but taste like ice cream.

Look how fast, fun, and easy it is for them to make their favorite cones. And the best part is the Dessert Bullet takes up no more room on your countertop than a coffee mug, and takes just seconds to use and seconds to clean. Watch.

So innovative it pretty much markets itself. Like Apple's iPad. Just throw the product on camera and the dazzling new features will get her done on the marketing. Now this works fine if you've got groundbreaking bells and whistles. But what do you do if your product is, well, kind of boring? Today, how to get even dull features to stand out. Make no mistake, there's nothing special about this cereal. But the cool visuals keep your brain engaged and you end up listening to every single product feature. And that's the new Kellogg's Fiber Plus. Now this next cereal ad doesn't engage. It simply drones on with a dull list of product features. The best approach to food is to keep it whole for better nutrition. That's what they do with Great Grains cereal. They steam and bake the actual whole grain while the other guy's flake is more processed. Mmm, Great Grains, the whole, whole grain cereal. Completely forgettable. Nobody's that excited about cereal. So you've got to strike a deal with the viewer. You agree to entertain them with cool comedy or visuals, and they agree to listen to your sales pitch. If your product features aren't that different, you always got to pay the toll. This Ford ad lists feature after feature. We speak car. We speak RPMs so you can zip by other cars. But we also speak MPGs so you can fly by gas stations. This spot's visually average and not funny. Ford didn't pay the toll. Now, contrast that car ad with this eye popper. It's visually riveting, and it still gets you excited. It's in the sales pitch. So remember, unless your product brings something truly new and amazing to the table, you're going to have to bribe your customers to listen to your spiel. Remember, in advertising, entertainment is not optional. I'm Graham Newell, and that's emotional marketing.

doing a commercial on Christmas! So, everybody knows what Christmas is, don't they? I don't. You don't know what Christmas is? No, I don't, I don't. Explain to me, what is Christmas? Well, Christmas is the time we celebrate the birth of Jesus, and we give each other gifts and presents, and families meet up and do stuff together. Wow, that sounds pretty cool. So, what's this thing about Santa Claus? Well, if you ask a kid what Christmas is about, or one person related to Christmas, quite a few of them would say Santa Claus. Well, Santa Claus is a guy that goes around the world on Christmas Eve, delivering presents to all the kids that are any good during the year. And, if you're lucky, sometimes you might see him. Cool! I've never seen Santa Claus, can I see him? Well, if you stay up late enough on Christmas Eve, then you might be able to see him, if you're lucky. Oh, cool! I might go do that now! But it's not Christmas Eve! Oh well! Okay then, right, so, the next section is Santa Claus. So, I'm very lucky today because in the studio with me I have Santa Claus, the real Santa Claus. So, say hi to the camera. Um, hi people on YouTube and the world. Okay, so, do you mind if I interview you? No, not a bit, go ahead. Okay then, what's your name? My name is Santa Claus. Oh, I see. My name is Santa Claus, um, Saint Nick, Father Christmas, loads, I have loads of different names. You can have more than one name? Yes, you can. Yeah, I have more than one name. Some people call me Mr. Bollocks, some people call me Goomba the Paravirt, some people call me Pedo. Okay, I don't really want to know the rest. Okay, so, number two. Why do you deliver presents to the kids on Christmas Eve? Well, I like kids. Wait, that sounded a bit sick. Everything sounds sick to you. Well, I like kids. And if they've been good during the year, I will deliver them presents. And they can open them on Christmas Day. Have you ever gone to someone's house and a kid has seen you? Yeah, quite a lot of times it's happened actually. Oh, cool. I've never seen you. Well, you have now because I'm right here in your studio with me. Oh, right. So, thank you Santa Claus and I shall see you soon. Okay, have a Merry Christmas. Hope you have a good Christmas too. Okay then, next we're going to talk about reindeer. Okay, so, next we're going to talk about reindeer. So, I have Santa's nine reindeer in the studio with me as well. And the most popular reindeer I think is Rudolph because everybody knows who he is. So, hi Rudolph, how are you? I'm great actually, thanks for asking. So, you're Santa's main reindeer and you go at the front of the sleigh and guide him, don't you, with your red nose? That is true. Have you ever been flying around in the sky and crashed into a building? Uh, no, I don't think so anyway from memory. Has any of the other reindeers crashed into a building? Well, the others went on strike last year and went to a beefer where they went to a big rave club. I've been to a beefer. Cool, what was your experience of it like? Oh, I got kicked out of every club. Uh, why may I ask? Well, I drank a bit of too much alcohol and, yeah, you can kind of guess what happened next. Oh, right. So, where are the reindeer and where can I be flying around this Christmas Eve delivering presents helping Santa? Oh, yeah, I know Santa. Oh, cool. So, um, yeah, thanks for coming in the studio with me today. You're welcome. Okay, right, next we're going to talk about other things about Christmas. So, if you know what Christmas is, you probably know what a Christmas tree is. Like this thing here, this is one that I have in my room and as you can see compared, it's not that very big, but compared to me, it is quite big. So, we're going to go take a look at the Christmas tree downstairs, which is a real one and it's bigger. So, let's go have a look. So, this thing here is a real Christmas tree and, yeah, that's absolutely quite big, I think. Like, I'll put me down here. Like, there's the size of me and then there's the size of the actual Christmas tree. So, as seen, it's very big. So, now we're going to go have a look at some Christmas decorations. You can get Christmas ornaments like this. I don't know what it actually is meant to be. It just looks like a big, long cone thing. And, like, here are some ornaments. Like, you can have a Santa Claus, you can have a Mrs. Claus, and I think that's meant to go on a table. Yeah. So, these things here are Santa hats. They're not really classed as decorations, but you can wear them. And I think we have one, two, three, four. Yeah. So, now we're going to go back up to the bedroom and carry on. So, I have these four lucky people with me today in the studio. And we're going to go have a look at the Christmas tree. And we're going to be talking to them about why they like Christmas. So, firstly, you. What's your name? Hi, I am Toadsworth. Now, why do you like Christmas? Well, I like Christmas because I spend it with my family and friends. And it gives me a really good feeling. And, yeah, that's why I like Christmas. Cool. So, now we're going to move on to the next person. Weegee. I think that's you anyway. Yeah, that's me. Why do you like Christmas? Um, well, I get presents and it's a really good time. Is that it? Yeah, pretty much. Mario, why do you like presents? Well, like presents? I mean, like Christmas. Well, I think everybody likes presents anyway. Well, I like presents and Christmas. Because with Christmas, you get to spend it with your family. For example, I spent it with Luigi here. Hi. And, um, yeah. I enjoy it and it's one of my favourite times of the year. Ah, cool. So, final person. Why do you like Christmas? Well, I like Christmas.

The Slush Mug consists of two parts, an insulated plastic mug and the patent pending Glacier Core insert. The Glacier Core is the secret to creating a perfect slushie consistency. The non-toxic, super freezing refrigerant sealed inside the Glacier Core works to cool your drink to 34 degrees Fahrenheit and crystallizes the liquid without watering it down. The same can't be said when trying to make a slushie using ice in a blender. All you end up with is a weak, watered down version of the original flavor. Making a full flavored slushie with the Slush Mug is simple. Just freeze the Glacier Core for about six hours and place it back inside the plastic mug. Then, pour your beverage of choice into the Glacier Core and stir occasionally for about six minutes. The liquid will gradually turn to black. The result is a delicious, ready to eat frozen treat. The insulated plastic mug helps maintain your drink's slushie consistency for about two hours. So there's no need to rush and risk brain freeze. Each Slush Mug holds up to 12 ounces of your favorite sodas, fruit juices, flavored milks, flavored teas, coffees and just about anything else you can think of except for artificially sweetened drinks such as diet sodas. The Slush Mug is made in the U.S. and comes with a lifetime guarantee from the manufacturer. So buy one for every member of your family and make slushies and flavors you never thought possible.

Designers call this the Barbie look, this great new fashion look. And these bendable legs really look so natural, and the way that they move is so lifelike that you'd really be amazed at all the things they can do, and the way that you pose them is up to you. You can sit them on a sofa or the edge of a bed, or you can make them sit right on the floor instead. They can cross their legs and relax a while, or sit down to dinner in formal style. You can pose them together in dozens of ways. You can even have them dancing the latest crazy. You can put them in a really swinging pose, and they look so graceful in all their clothes. And that's just a part of the fashion look, the great new Barbie look.

We taught our self-driving bike to figure out where it is, what's around it, what will happen next and what it should do. We leaned on Google's expertise in self-driving cars, but we had to adapt the technology to work on a bike. We designed a bike that is more comfortable, more comfortable for the user, and more comfortable for the driver. We designed a bike that is more comfortable, more comfortable for the user, and more comfortable for the driver. We decided to add two additional features. First, you can request the bike to pick you up wherever you are. And we developed a comfort mode, adjusting the pedals to a perfect resting position. I think the self-riding bike could really give a boost to the economy because people could also work on their bicycle. You work in your office, you work in your home, you work in your car. You could even work on your bike. I have so much more time. My kids love it. They're just free. They can go anywhere they want, anytime they want. It's amazing.

So I've got some French beans here that I've just steamed for a couple of minutes. The rice, straight in there. I'll give you a little bit of an extra surprise. So the chili's going to give it some extra flavor. Uh-huh. Love a bit of fresh basil. Yeah, lovely. So there is mixed bean and five grain salad. We've got a long day at work. Long day, long day. The problem I've got is that I come home and then I do all my cooking. It takes bloody ages. And then by the time I've eaten, I'm ready for bed. Yeah, I know what you mean, mate. Life gets busy. But then I've got wicked whole grain and quinoa in a bag, two minutes, and you're away. And this goes great with fish, chicken, turkey, beef. So really can have it with any protein sauce. And that's it. My grilled chicken, whole grain and quinoa, nice vegetables. I can see you eyeballing my salmon. You want a bit, don't you? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've got some really nice quinoa and whole grain with tomato and basil. And there you go, look. This is grilled salmon. You've got the whole grains and quinoa with tomato and basil. So give it a go.

Farmers and suburban homeowners using garden tractors for tilling the soil, mowing lawns, clearing snow. Small trucks moving men and materials over ranches and estates. Rescue vehicles going where they're needed. Oil prospectors and engineers staking out remote parts of the world. People getting away from cities to hunt and play. A four billion dollar market, but not without its problems. Garden tractors are limited in number. Garden tractors are limited in number. They're used. Pickup trucks limited in what they can do. Most rescue vehicles can't penetrate real wilderness. And vehicles that can are complex to maintain. In a world of rising costs, off-road fun for many is no longer affordable. Vehicles designed to carry six, carrying one. Wasted space. No longer tolerable. Clearly, there's a real need for a simple, sustainable, sustainable, sustainable, sustainable four wheel drive vehicle. Simple, four wheel drive vehicle that's economical to maintain, easy to repair, inexpensive, yet reliable and rugged, even under the toughest conditions. How would we build it? We start with a corrosion resistant frame formed from low carbon alloy steel tubes. Lightweight and cut. We add a suspension system with ample wheel travel using coil bearings, a two-door, four wheel drive system, and a four wheel drive system, which is a little more difficult in the first place. The suspension system is two-door, and the suspension system is two-door. travel using coil springs front and rear that keeps all four wheels firmly on the ground on uneven road surfaces. We control roll and spread the load evenly through coaxially mounted heavy-duty shock absorbers. Simple, safe, reliable. We design in a generous ground clearance by using 15-inch diameter wheels mounted with wide section tires so as not to sink in soft dirt. Make sure there's no dangling oil lines or fuel pipes, no exposed transmission shafts, no problems from undergrowth. The power goes directly to the front and rear solid axles through special gear trains geared for pulling or urban commuting. The driveline and suspension linkage is designed to be simple yet rugged. We position the engine in midships mounted transversely, a two-cylinder 30 to 40 horsepower air cooler or a four-cylinder engine. We use a single-engine engine that is equipped with a single-engine engine. We use a single-engine engine that is equipped with a single-engine engine. We use a single-engine engine up to 75 horsepower, both off the shelf, mass-produced, so you can get parts anywhere. On most present cross-country vehicles, the load space is less than a third of the length, the engine taking up another third, and two persons the rest. A waste. On our unit, more than two-thirds of the length is hauling space, useful space. The load platform is a simple composite structural sheet. The problem with usual utility vehicles is field repairs. With ours, remove the lightweight flooring to get at the entire powertrain for rapid replacement or repair. Driver and passengers sit above and ahead of the wheels. Good visibility. This driving position creates confidence in the vehicle. No more guessing what's beyond a big hood when descending a steep hill. You can see. Rugged simplicity, very low cost, four-wheel drive, large utility space, half-ton capacity, and ability to go anywhere.

Busy you, in and out of doors every day. Think how much dust and dirt settle on your skin. And makeup clings to your skin too and clogs pores. That's why your face needs a thorough cleansing each day. And that's why cleansing tests were made by an independent testing laboratory. This same kind of dirt was made just radioactive enough to register on a Geiger counter. Leading cleansing creams, complexion soaps, and Dorothy Gray Salon cold cream were used to remove this dirt. The Geiger counter proved that Dorothy Gray Salon cold cream cleanses up to two and a half times more thoroughly than any soap or other cleansing cream tested. When you cleanse with Dorothy Gray Salon cold cream, you know that you're not going to get any more dirt on your face. So you remove dirt. And more important, you remove every trace of makeup which can clog your pores. That's why Salon cold cream is especially recommended for a young complexion. A clean skin is a healthy skin. And your skin will look smoother and clearer when you use Dorothy Gray Salon cold cream. It's so quick and easy too. Takes no more time than improper cleansing.

What's growing on our Buicks and Pontiacs is the gas mileage. The EPA has tested the Regal, the Sabre, and Grand Prix at 19 City and 26 Highway. What's shrinking is the price. At Cornelius, we've discounted every Regal, the Sabre, and Grand Prix in stock 10% off the low-brace price. That's from $5. The price is now $100 to $800 off. The mileage is up, the prices are down. This week at Cornelius in Fairfield. Here we are, Sue, both of us trying to lose weight, but suddenly you can resist Mario's chocolate cake. What happened? I went to Schick, Ellen. I don't crave chocolate anymore. Come on, you. Or any other fattening foods. Schick taught me that cravings for the wrong foods are conditioned reflexes. Your willpower doesn't stand a chance. Tell me. But how does Schick help? Mild counter conditioning. It puts this in control instead of this. You lose the cravings. Call 485-1441.

From the very beginning, the iPad was designed to be very powerful, very capable, but also remarkably simple to use. So our goal was to take all the amazing things that you can do with a 4 size iPad, but pack them into a product that is so much smaller. And that's why we decided to do this video, That's what we did with the new iPad Mini. One of the things that makes iPads so incredible is that there's almost no end to what you can do with it. So when we decided to make the iPad Mini, we wanted to make sure it had all the features that make iPads so magical. We began with a display that has the same resolution as the iPad 2. So all your apps and content look and work the same way. And at 7.9 inches, it's small enough to fit in one hand, but it's still large enough to give you that rich, immersive iPad experience. It has a dual-core A5 chip for fast fluid performance, both FaceTime and iSight cameras. It gets a full 10 hours of battery life, and it runs more than 275,000 apps made just for iPad. These aren't scaled-up phone apps. These are powerful apps that take full advantage of iPad Mini's beautiful display. And another thing we're really excited about is that iPad Mini comes with FaceTime HD. Seeing your friends and family in high definition makes you feel like you're that much closer. If all that we had done was take the original iPad and just reduce it, all that you would be aware of was everything that was just missing. That there is inherent loss in just reducing a product, and that there is a lack of product in size. And what we did was we went back to the very beginning, and we took the time to design a product that was a concentration of, not a reduction of the original. We felt strongly that 7.9 inches was exactly the right display size, but it became clear that we had to reduce the width of the borders, so you can still pick it up and easily use it with one hand. We have a new product, and we're going to show you how to do it. We have a new product, and we're going to show you how to do it. We have continued to develop our unibody process. There are essentially two parts to the enclosure, the glass and the aluminium. And that junction where the two parts actually come together is incredibly important. The diamond cut chamfer meets seamlessly with the glass, and I think it's a beautiful detail that further reduces parts and actually makes it more durable. We also designed an entirely new smart cover for the iPad Mini. By eliminating the separate aluminium hinge, we now essentially wrap the iPad Mini in a single, simple coloured material. The biggest challenge that we faced was incorporating all these great features in a much smaller and lighter device. In order to do this, every part had to be custom designed, starting with the display. The glass on the front and back are only 0.2mm thin. The touch subsystem is a mere 0.12mm thick. It weighs half as much as any we've ever done before. Beyond the screen, we took some dramatic steps to maximize interior space. It has the largest and thinnest single-cell battery we've ever designed. We designed a smaller motherboard to house the powerful A5 chip, and built in the new, smaller lightning connector. We also redesigned the EyeSight and FaceTime HD cameras, and they allow you to take amazing photos in HD video. We've been able to build all of this technology and make it a very, very powerful device. It's only 0.68 pounds and 7.2mm thin. All of these efforts combine to make a product that is incredibly thin and light, and has absolutely remarkable levels of fit and finish. And I think the result is an extraordinary iPad. One that will be used in so many different places, in so many different ways.\", 'segments': [{'id': 0, 'seek': 0, 'start': 0.0, 'end': 2.0, 'text': ' Læs merks!', 'tokens': [50365, 441, 7303, 82,

I've seen a lot of tough errors, a lot of downturns in my life, and times when we didn't understand each other. It seems that we've lost our heart at times.

We find a way through tough times, and if we can't find a way, then we'll make one. All that matters now is what's ahead. How do we come from behind? How do we come together? And how do we win? Detroit's showing us it can be done. And what's true about them is true about all of us. This country can't be knocked out with one punch.

Experimental cars are displayed at places such as the World's Fair to evoke consumer . When many opinions are evaluated, the features consumers like. As the search for beauty continues, the stylist focuses on the future that lies just ahead. Years ago, custom-built horseless carriages reflected the tastes of the very wealthy. Today, the lowest-priced cars provide attractive and tasteful interiors. And stylists are working on many ways to make them even more comfortable and more exciting in years to come. To please a very style-conscious public, the interior designer evaluates thousands of fabrics before making a selection.

Yet, in order to exercise his art, he must have a working knowledge of engineering, of the properties of many materials, and of costs and sources of supply. Thus, he is an industrial designer who applies total performance of vehicles. Sometimes, the stylist's experiments are not enough to satisfy the needs of the customer. The designer is the one who is the most important person in the design of the car.
